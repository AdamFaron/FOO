# FOO
Fleet Of One: Application to maintain and track personal assets such as receipts, documents, cars etc.

- User can use the application track receipts, documents and links for personal assets (furnaces, cars, ...)
- Support Expandable Asset Type - Everything can be optional if there is no additional business rule. User many even define 'Trip' as an asset type, create 1 trip as asset and add all documents related to the trip. If an asset needs to support additional rules, user needs to tag the required properties. For example, to support PM forecasting, the asset needs to have meter reading, user needs to tag the property as 'Meter Reading' before the system can do PM forecasting.
- User can publish new Asset Type for all user to use.
- We will use all FAR client technology (i.e. HTML5, CSS, Javascript, AngularJS 2, Bootstrap, Git, Ionic)
- We will use MongoDB as the backend database.
- The application will be hosted in the cloud (Digital Ocean, Azure). 
- Offline possibility
